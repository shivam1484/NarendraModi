                <h2>Prime Minister</h2>
                <p>Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: [ˈnəɾendɾə dɑmodəɾˈdɑs ˈmodiː] (listen); born 17 September
                    1950)[b] is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current prime minister of India since 2014.
                    Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament from
                    Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
                    (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest serving
                    prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.

                    Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary
                    education. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out after
                    school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar railway station. At age 18, Modi was married to
                    Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as his
                    wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with
                    her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his
                    parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged.
                    Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of
                    emergency was declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS
                    assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001,
                    rising to the rank of general secretary.[c]

                    Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and
                    poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly
                    soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044
                    people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim,[d] or otherwise criticised for its
                    management of the crisis. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India found
                    no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.[e] While his policies as
                    chief minister—credited with encouraging economic growth—have received praise, his administration
                    was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the
                    state.[f]

                    Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the lower house of
                    Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's
                    administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced
                    spending on healthcare, education, and social welfare programmes. Modi centralised power by
                    abolishing the Planning Commission and replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He began a high-profile
                    sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and a
                    transformation of the taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. He
                    oversaw the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Prime Minister, Modi has received
                    consistently high approval ratings</p>
